# eVue Control Interview Project

Hello and thanks for your time. The application is a simple React app that is deployed to ZEIT and it uses Redux with Immer.js(Creates Immutable objects) for the cache and Material-UI for custom components. JSS is used for component styling and Yarn for package management.

## Getting Started

https://github.com/eltijuas1988/evue-interview-dashboard

clone the repo and then once you 'cd' into repo run the following:

yarn && yarn start

That is it!!

## Deployment

If you would like to see the application running without having to run any of the steps above, go to:

## Insecure Content Blocked Warning

If the application dashboard returns 'No Data Available' in red, you may have a 'Insecure Content Blocked Warning'. If you get this warning, be sure to enable 'load unsafe scripts' from your browser. This warning is due to the application running on HTTPS and the resource for the API running on HTTP.
